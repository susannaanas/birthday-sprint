title: "What's a #BirthdaySprint?"
---

On August 10th, 2013 there will be birthday celebrations around the world for OpenStreetMap's 9th birthday. In order to celebrate, we've decided to hold a distributed code sprint during the birthday weekend. What this means is that anyone with an OSM software project can rally their community to do a dedicated push over those two days. Our goal is to energize developers around the project's anniversary. 

The following projects will be participating-- feel free to add yours!

## OSM Groups

* Description: We are pushing to get the Groups Feature ready for an initial launch!
* Issues: [This wiki page](https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/wiki/Groups) has gathered the needs. Also, we [label issues related to the groups branch with 'groups'](https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/issues?labels=groups&page=1&state=open).
* Code: The [groups sketch tree](https://github.com/osmlab/openstreetmap-website/tree/groups-sketch) is where we're working.
* We have a [live instance](http://groups.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/) here that has the working functionality. You need a separate account on the dev instance to gain access to all functionality. See a sample group [here](http://groups.apis.dev.openstreetmap.org/groups/2).

## Wikimaps

* Description: Wikimaps is an initiative to bridge upload, storage and rectification of old maps in the Wikimedia Commons to Open Historical Map and eventually to sharing the geographic data between OHM and Wikimedia. We present on August 10 in Wikimania in Hong Kong. Check out http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Wikimaps/Wikimaps_Tartu%E2%80%93Hong_Kong. There will be rectified to play around with.
* Issues: -

* Leads: Susanna Ånäs

## Historical OSM

* Make Time aware Tiles.  1) wrangle the mapnik xml to be time aware, and build a couple of static tile sets (maybe for 2008/2009 Burning Man :). 2) Work on mod_tile to pass time range from the url through to mapnik. So it really depends on your interest and capacity. There are also other things that could be done.
